# BYOXC (Build Your Own Course - MVP)

This is an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** for an AI-powered platform that generates project-based learning courses (inspired by CodeCrafters, Build Your Own X, and FullStackOpen).  
The goal of this MVP is to validate whether **AI can generate useful, structured, and practical learning paths** for developers.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Test if course generation using AI is possible.
- Provide users with a starting point for **guided, project-based learning**.
- Gather feedback to improve UI, course quality, and overall user experience.

## ⚡ Features (MVP)

- Generate a new course with a single click.
- Display and manage your generated courses.
