<instructions>
Generate a complete course outline in JSON format.

Your task:

- Divide the course into small chunks of chapters based on the learner's difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
- For each chapter, include:
  - **title**: A concise and clear chapter name.
  - **description**: A brief explanation and goal of the chapter.
  - **body**: A step-by-step tutorial-style guide that the learner can follow independently. You must follow the following rules when creating the body:
    - Must be formatted in a markdown style for easy formatting.
    - Use the appropriate markdown syntax for headers, sections, code snippets, etc.
    - Do not put the steps in a list or numbered list.
    - If there are code snippets provided, always include an explanation.
    - Construct each step that can be easy to follow for human 
  - **exercises**: A list (1 to 5) of exercises to reinforce the chapter content. You must follow the following rules:
    - Exercise should not be exactly the same in any of the provided step-by-step guide at the body
    - Must be related to the knowledge that was gained for the current chapter
    - You can add a more advanced exercise (as a bonus exercise to the user) but indicate that it's not required and that it is more advance. They can do it if they want more challenge.
  - **resources**: Provide relevant external links with titles (e.g., videos, docs, articles) to help with the exercises.

Rules:

- Output must be valid JSON inside a single object.
- Do not include any prose, markdown, or notes outside of the JSON.
- Each chapter must include all fields.
- Focus on practicality and clarity — this will be presented directly to end users.
- You are allowed to be creative and educationally sound when structuring tutorials and exercises.
- When constructing the chapter 2 onwards, make sure that the knowledge from the previous chapter will be used. 
- If you require more specific information from the user in order to make the course better (such as their preferred tools, platforms, or configurations), call the appropriate function instead of generating the course immediately. See the <function_call_rules> tag for the rules you need to follow when using the function call.
  </instructions>

<function_call_rules>
You are allowed to call the function `getUserPreference` to ask the user a specific question to clarify their preferences.

When calling the function, follow these rules:
- Only use the function call **if necessary** — specifically when you encounter a decision point in course creation where user preference is required and not yet provided.
- The `question` parameter must be short, direct, and clearly state what preference is being asked.
- The `choices` parameter must include **4 to 5 options**, ranked based on relevance, popularity, and general best practices.
- Always include **"I don't know, pick for me"** as the last option in the choices array.
- If the user selects **"I don't know, pick for me"**, you must automatically choose the **most optimal and commonly used** option based on the topic and difficulty level provided by the user.

Use the terminal to navigate to where you want your project to live:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my_http_server\ncd my_http_server\n```\n\n### Creating Your First Python File\n\nInside the folder, create a new Python file that will contain your server logic:\n\n```bash\ntouch server.py\n```\n\nOpen this file in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).\n\n### Writing a Simple Print Statement\n\nIn `server.py`, add the following code:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Server setup complete\")\n```\n\nSave the file and run it:\n\n```bash\npython server.py\n```\n\nYou should see the message printed in the terminal.
